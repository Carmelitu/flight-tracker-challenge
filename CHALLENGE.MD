Build a full stack solution for a mini-application that tracks flights. The application should provide a simple frontend that allows for the creation of a new flight tracking reference along with a visualization of the current status of actively tracked flights. It should include a status: AWAITING, DEPARTED, or ARRIVED and a button to delete the tracking reference. There should also be a button to refresh the status of all currently tracked flights.

The backend should be dependent on two data sources: Flight Aware, and Flight Stats. Each provider should accept a flight number and return a response in the form of: { actualDepartureTime: string | null, actualArrivalTime: string | null } or an error in the form of { error: string } No need to implement the third party integration with these providers, just mock the data responses. You can use local storage on the frontend to persist the UI state. Please use React for the frontend, and express with typescript for the backend. No need to implement authentication, database storage, logging, or cloud deployments, but be prepared to talk through these considerations in a final code review. 

Feel free to use any tools at your disposal including AI-code assistants but save any prompts you do use and commit them in a prompts.md file in the repository. Also include any mock data and tests that you use during the development process. Commit the code to a public github repository and submit the project by sending a link to that repository. Try to spend no more than 20 hours on the project if possible
